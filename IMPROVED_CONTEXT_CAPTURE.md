# Improved Context Capture - Now More Accurate!

## What I Fixed

The cross-tab memory was working but wasn't capturing enough email content. Now it captures **MUCH more complete information**.

### Changes Made:

**1. Platform-Specific Content Extraction âœ…**

Instead of generic text capture, now has specialized extractors for:
- **Gmail** - Captures subject, from, date, and FULL email body
- **Outlook** - Captures email content properly
- **Slack** - Captures recent messages in conversation
- **Generic pages** - More complete content capture

**2. Increased Content Limits âœ…**
- **Before:** 3,000 characters per page
- **Now:** 10,000 characters per page
- **Before:** 1,000 chars shown to AI from previous tabs
- **Now:** Full 10,000 chars shown to AI

**3. Better Gmail Email Capture âœ…**

Specifically targets Gmail selectors:
```javascript
- Email subject (.hP)
- Email from (.gD)
- Email date (.g3)
- Email body (.a3s.aiL) - FULL CONTENT
```

### How It Works Now:

**When you're on Gmail:**
1. Detects you're on mail.google.com
2. Finds email subject, from, date
3. Captures **entire email body** (up to 10,000 chars)
4. Stores it for cross-tab access

**When you ask from another tab:**
1. Retrieves full email content from memory
2. Sends **complete email** to Gemini
3. AI reads the full email including deadline info
4. Answers accurately

### Test the Fix:

**Step 1: Reload Extension**
```
1. chrome://extensions/
2. Find SyncUp
3. Click reload ðŸ”„
```

**Step 2: Re-read the Email**
```
1. Go back to Gmail
2. Open the assignment email again
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Space
4. Ask: "test" (this stores the FULL email content)
5. Close palette (ESC)
```

**Step 3: Test from Another Tab**
```
1. Switch to Wikipedia or any other tab
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Space
3. Ask: "what is the assignment deadline?"
4. Should now find it in the email! âœ…
```

### What Changed in Code:

**content/universal-content.js**

Added specialized capture functions:
- `captureGmailContent()` - Lines 540-569
- `captureOutlookContent()` - Lines 574-588
- `captureSlackContent()` - Lines 593-607
- `captureGenericContent()` - Lines 612-638

**background.js**

Increased limits:
- Line 626: Storage limit 5000 â†’ 10000 chars
- Line 553: Context sent to AI 1000 â†’ 10000 chars (full content)

### Gmail Selectors Explained:

These are the specific parts of Gmail's HTML we target:

| Selector | What It Captures | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| `.a3s.aiL` | Email body text | "The assignment is due..." |
| `.hP` | Email subject | "Minor Assignment â€“ 01 Submission" |
| `.gD` | Email sender | "Mohammad Maksood Akhter" |
| `.g3` | Email date | "Friday, October 17, 3:16 PM" |

### Example Output:

**Before (incomplete):**
```
Page: Gmail
Subject: Minor Assignment â€“ 01 Submission
From: Mohammad Maksood Akhter
Date: Friday, October 17, 3:16 PM

Email Content: [only first 1000 chars, might cut off]
```

**After (complete):**
```
Page: Gmail
Subject: Minor Assignment â€“ 01 Submission
From: Mohammad Maksood Akhter
Date: Friday, October 17, 3:16 PM (4 days ago)

Email Content:
[FULL email body including:
- Assignment instructions
- Deadline information
- Submission requirements
- All other details
- Up to 10,000 characters]
```

### Why It's Better:

**Before:**
- Captured partial email (3000 chars max)
- Only sent 1000 chars to AI from previous tabs
- Might miss important info at end of email
- Generic capture missed Gmail structure

**After:**
- Captures full email (10,000 chars)
- Sends full content to AI
- Gets complete context including deadlines
- Gmail-aware capture gets all metadata

### Troubleshooting:

**If still not finding deadline:**

1. **Re-capture the email:**
   ```
   - Go to Gmail tab
   - Open the email
   - Ctrl+Shift+Space
   - Ask any question (to trigger storage)
   - This stores fresh, complete content
   ```

2. **Check what was captured:**
   ```
   - Open Console (F12) on Gmail
   - After asking question, look for:
   - "ðŸ“¸ Captured page context, length: XXXX"
   - Should be much larger now (5000-10000)
   ```

3. **Check background storage:**
   ```
   - chrome://extensions/
   - Click "service worker"
   - Look for: "ðŸ’¾ Stored context for: [email subject]"
   - Should show full email was stored
   ```

4. **Verify cross-tab retrieval:**
   ```
   - Switch to another tab
   - Open Console (F12)
   - Ask question
   - Background console should show:
   - "ðŸ§  Retrieved context from X recent tabs"
   - "Page 1: Minor Assignment..."
   ```

### Known Limitations:

1. **Gmail Dynamic Loading:**
   - Some emails load content dynamically
   - May need to scroll down in email to load full content
   - Then ask question to capture loaded content

2. **Very Long Emails:**
   - Still limited to 10,000 chars
   - Should be enough for most emails
   - If email is longer, only first 10k captured

3. **Attachments:**
   - Does NOT capture file attachments
   - Does NOT read PDFs or documents
   - Only captures visible text

### Future Improvements:

Could add:
- PDF text extraction
- Attachment file name capture
- Email thread capture (all replies)
- Calendar event parsing
- Link extraction

### Supported Platforms:

Now has specialized capture for:
- âœ… Gmail (mail.google.com)
- âœ… Outlook (outlook.live.com, outlook.office.com)
- âœ… Slack (slack.com)
- âœ… All other sites (generic capture with 10k limit)

### Example Conversation:

**On Gmail Tab:**
```
User: test
AI: [Captures full email with deadline info]
Badge: ðŸ“„ Used current page
```

**On Wikipedia Tab:**
```
User: what is the assignment deadline?
AI: From the email you were reading, the assignment deadline is [exact date from email]
Badge: ðŸ”„ Used previous tab
```
