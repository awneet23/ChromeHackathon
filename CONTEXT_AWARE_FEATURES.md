# 🧠 Context-Aware Command Palette - Now Live!

## What You Asked For

> "it should have the entire context like if on some previous screen i was reading a letter and i ask a question from this it should be able to answer that question and for that i guess it need to see my screen so make it work this way, and it should remember like if i am seeing my mail and then i go on to other tab and ask question related to it on the other tab it should be able to answer it"

## What I Built

### ✅ Current Page Context Capture
The command palette now **sees everything on your current screen**:
- All visible text on the page
- Page title and URL
- Meta descriptions
- Main headings (H1, H2)
- Main content areas
- Article text, email content, etc.

### ✅ Cross-Tab Memory
The extension now **remembers what you viewed on other tabs**:
- Stores context from last 10 tabs you visited
- Keeps memory for 5 minutes
- Automatically saves page content when you ask questions
- Retrieves context from recent tabs when answering

### ✅ Intelligent Context Usage
The AI now:
- Uses current page context to answer questions
- Refers to previous tabs you were viewing
- Tells you which source it used (current page / previous tab / general knowledge)
- Shows a badge indicating context source

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: Question About Current Page

**What you do:**
1. You're reading an email about a project deadline
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Space`
3. Ask: "When is the deadline?"

**What happens:**
1. Extension captures all text from the email
2. Sends it to Gemini AI along with your question
3. AI reads the email content
4. Answers: "From the email you're reading, the deadline is March 15th"
5. Shows badge: **📄 Used current page**

---

### Scenario 2: Question About Previous Tab

**What you do:**
1. You read an email with meeting details on Tab 1
2. Switch to Tab 2 (Twitter)
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Space`
4. Ask: "What time is the meeting?"

**What happens:**
1. Extension retrieves context from Tab 1 (email you just read)
2. Sends both current tab and previous email context to AI
3. AI finds the meeting time in the previous email
4. Answers: "From the email you were reading, the meeting is at 2 PM"
5. Shows badge: **🔄 Used previous tab**

---

### Scenario 3: General Knowledge

**What you do:**
1. You're on any random page
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Space`
3. Ask: "What is machine learning?"

**What happens:**
1. Extension checks current page and recent tabs
2. Question is not related to any viewed content
3. AI provides general knowledge answer
4. Shows badge: **💡 General knowledge**

## Technical Implementation

### Current Page Context Capture

**File:** `content/universal-content.js`
**Function:** `capturePageContent()`

Captures:
```javascript
- Page Title
- Page URL
- Meta Description
- H1 and H2 headings
- Main content (article, main tag, role=main)
- Body text (first 3000 chars)
```

**Triggered:** When you press Enter in command palette

---

### Cross-Tab Memory Storage

**File:** `background.js`
**Functions:** `storeTabContext()`, `getRecentTabsContext()`

**Storage:**
- Uses `chrome.storage.local`
- Stores last 10 tabs
- Each context includes:
  - Tab ID
  - URL
  - Title
  - Content (first 5000 chars)
  - Timestamp

**Retention:**
- Keeps contexts for 5 minutes
- Automatically cleans old contexts
- Max 5 recent tabs used per query

---

### Context-Aware AI Prompting

**File:** `background.js`
**Function:** `handleCommandPaletteQuestion()`

**Process:**
1. Capture current page context
2. Store it for future use
3. Retrieve contexts from last 5 minutes
4. Build comprehensive context string
5. Send to Gemini with instructions to:
   - Use context when available
   - Refer to source specifically
   - Fall back to general knowledge
   - Indicate which source was used

**Prompt Format:**
```
USER'S CONTEXT:
=== CURRENT PAGE CONTEXT ===
[Current page content]

=== RECENTLY VIEWED PAGES ===
Page 1: Email Title
Content: [Email content]

Page 2: Article Title
Content: [Article content]

Question: [User's question]
```

---

## Context Source Badges

The answer now shows which source was used:

| Badge | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **📄 Used current page** | Answer from page you're viewing | Reading email, ask about sender |
| **🔄 Used previous tab** | Answer from tab you viewed earlier | Read email, switch tabs, ask about it |
| **🧠 Used context** | Answer from browsing history | General context from multiple tabs |
| **💡 General knowledge** | Answer not in your browsing context | Ask about ML when reading news |

---

## Memory Limits (For Performance)

### Storage Limits
- **Max tabs stored:** 10 tabs
- **Content per tab:** 5000 characters
- **Context retention:** 5 minutes
- **Max tabs per query:** 5 most recent

### Why These Limits?
- **Performance:** Keeps extension fast
- **Token limits:** Gemini has input token limits
- **Privacy:** Doesn't store too much browsing history
- **Relevance:** 5 minutes is enough for related questions

## Advanced Features

### Automatic Context Storage
Every time you ask a question, the current page context is automatically saved for future reference. This means:
- You don't need to manually capture anything
- Context builds up as you browse
- Questions get smarter over time in a session

### Time-Based Relevance
Contexts older than 5 minutes are automatically excluded because:
- They're likely no longer relevant
- Keeps AI focused on recent context
- Prevents confusion from old, unrelated content

### Smart Context Selection
The system sends only the 5 most recent tabs to AI:
- Prevents token overflow
- Focuses on most relevant content
- Maintains fast response times

---

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Text-only capture (no images, videos, or PDFs)
2. 5-minute memory window
3. Max 5 tabs considered per query
4. No persistent memory across browser restarts

### Potential Future Features
- Screenshot capture using Chrome API
- OCR for text in images
- Persistent long-term memory
- Configurable memory duration
- Context filtering (only specific sites)
- Manual context management UI

---

## How to Use - Quick Reference

### Basic Usage
1. **Browse normally** - Context is captured automatically
2. **Press Ctrl+Shift+Space** - Open command palette
3. **Ask anything** - About current page, previous tabs, or general knowledge
4. **Get smart answer** - AI uses context when available

### Tips for Best Results
- ✅ Ask specific questions about what you're viewing
- ✅ Keep questions focused on recent browsing (last 5 mins)
- ✅ Refer to content you just viewed
- ✅ Check the badge to see which source was used

### Examples of Good Questions
- "What's the sender's email address?" (reading email)
- "Summarize the main points" (reading article)
- "What time is the meeting?" (after viewing calendar)
- "What did they decide about the budget?" (after reading Slack)

## Troubleshooting

### Answer shows "💡 General knowledge" but should use context?
**Possible reasons:**
1. Content wasn't captured (check console for "📸 Captured page context")
2. Context expired (>5 minutes old)
3. AI didn't find question relevant to context
4. Page content is dynamic (loaded after page load)

**Solutions:**
- Ask more specific question
- Re-read the page before asking
- Check console logs for context capture

### No context from previous tab?
**Check:**
1. Did you ask a question on that tab? (context only stored when asking questions)
2. Was it within 5 minutes?
3. Check console: "🧠 Retrieved context from X recent tabs"
4. If X=0, no context was stored

**Solution:**
- Ask a dummy question on Tab 1 to store context
- Then switch to Tab 2 and ask real question

### Context too short or incomplete?
**Reason:**
- Content limited to 5000 chars per tab (performance)

**Solution:**
- Ask questions about specific sections
- Page content is prioritized (main/article tags first)

---

## Success Indicators

When everything works correctly:

✅ Console shows context capture: "📸 Captured page context"
✅ Console shows storage: "💾 Stored context for: [title]"
✅ Console shows retrieval: "🧠 Retrieved context from X recent tabs"
✅ Answer uses context: Badge shows 📄 or 🔄 or 🧠
✅ Answer references your content: "From the email..." "From the article you were reading..."
