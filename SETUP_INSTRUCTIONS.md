# SyncUp - Multi-Participant Speech Capture Setup

## How It Works Now

SyncUp captures speech from **ALL participants** in your Google Meet for real-time contextual summaries!

## ‚ú® New Feature: Built-in Chatbox

**Ask questions directly in the sidebar!** No need for wake words - just type your question in the chatbox and get instant AI-powered answers based on the full meeting context.

### Dual Capture Method

The extension uses TWO methods simultaneously for complete coverage:

1. **Google Meet Captions** (Primary - captures ALL participants)
   - Monitors Google Meet's caption system which transcribes EVERYONE's speech
   - Captures all participants in the meeting

2. **Your Microphone** (Backup + Real-time supplement)
   - Direct microphone capture for YOUR voice
   - Provides real-time transcription as backup
   - Works even if captions have delays

3. **Combined Processing**
   - Speech from ALL sources is buffered together
   - Processed every 15 seconds for contextual cards
   - Topics mentioned by ANY participant generate contextual information

## Setup Instructions

### Step 2: Start SyncUp

1. Open the SyncUp sidebar (click the üîç icon)

   - Everyone's voice via captions (including yours)

## How to Verify It's Working

   - `üé§ YOUR VOICE (microphone): [your words]` - Your microphone is working
   - `üìù Caption captured from participant: [text]` - Captions capturing all participants
   - `‚è∞ 15 seconds elapsed - Processing conversation from ALL participants` - Processing speech
3. When YOU speak: See both microphone capture AND caption capture
4. When OTHERS speak: See caption capture
5. Every 15 seconds: See processing messages and new contextual cards appear
