# SyncUp Changelog

## Latest Updates (Just Now!)

### ✅ Fixed & Improved

#### 1. **Chatbox Now Answers BOTH Ways** 🎯
**What changed:**
- Chatbox now provides BOTH meeting-specific AND general knowledge answers
- Clear labeling shows what was from the meeting vs. general knowledge

**Example:**
- Question: "What is Docker?"
- **If discussed in meeting:** Shows both what was said in meeting + general Docker info
- **If NOT in meeting:** Shows "Not discussed in meeting" + comprehensive general answer

**Technical details:**
- Updated `handleChatboxQuestionWithGemini()` in `background.js`
- New response format with `meetingAnswer` and `generalAnswer`
- Smart labeling with emojis (📍 From Meeting, 📚 General Knowledge, ℹ️ Not in meeting)

---

#### 2. **New Keyboard Shortcut** ⌨️
**What changed:**
- Changed from `Ctrl+K` → `Ctrl+Shift+Space`
- (Mac: `Cmd+K` → `Cmd+Shift+Space`)

**Why:**
- Many apps use Ctrl+K for their own search (Slack, Gmail, etc.)
- `Ctrl+Shift+Space` is unique and won't conflict

**Where updated:**
- `manifest.json` - Command configuration
- `content/universal-content.js` - Keyboard listener
- UI placeholders and help text

---

#### 3. **Side Panel Now Opens on Icon Click** 🎨
**What changed:**
- Click the extension icon → Side panel opens automatically
- No more popup needed

**How it works:**
- Removed default popup from manifest
- Added `chrome.action.onClicked` listener in background.js
- Calls `chrome.sidePanel.open()` on click

**What you'll see:**
- Beautiful side panel with:
  - 📡 Live Activity Feed
  - ✅ Action Items (template ready)
  - 💡 Context Cards Library
  - 📊 Stats dashboard

---

#### 4. **Fixed Gemini API Integration** 🤖
**What was broken:**
- Using wrong API endpoint (`v1beta`)
- Using non-existent model (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`)
- Got 404 errors

**What's fixed:**
- Correct endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1`
- Correct model: `gemini-2.5-flash` (latest stable)
- Added detailed error logging
- Verified API key works
