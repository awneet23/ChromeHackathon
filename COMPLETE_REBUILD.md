# SyncUp - Complete Rebuild Documentation ✅

## What Changed - Everything Rebuilt Properly

### 🎯 Core Features (How It Actually Works Now)

#### 1. **15-Second Auto-Generated Cards** 💡
**How it works:**
- Every 15 seconds, AI extracts keywords from conversation
- Example: Someone says "we should use docker mcp" → AI extracts "docker mcp"
- Then AI generates explanation card (like asking ChatGPT "what is docker mcp?")
- Cards appear automatically with teal border

**Flow:**
```
Conversation → 15 sec buffer → Extract keywords → Ask AI "what is X?" → Display card
```

**Example:**
```
Meeting: "Let's use docker mcp for our project"
          ↓ (15 seconds pass)
Card Generated:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💡 docker mcp                       │  ← Teal border
│ Docker MCP is...                    │
│ [AI explanation like ChatGPT would] │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 2. **Chatbox - Like Normal AI** 💬
**How it works:**
- Type ANY question in chatbox (meeting-related OR general)
- AI decides: use meeting context if relevant, otherwise answer generally
- Works like ChatGPT but knows about your meeting

**Examples:**

**Meeting-related question:**
```
You ask: "When is John's birthday?"
Context: Meeting mentioned "John's birthday is Nov 12"
Answer: Uses meeting context → "Based on the meeting, John's birthday is November 12"
```

**General question:**
```
You ask: "What is Docker?"
Answer: General knowledge → "Docker is a containerization platform..."
```

#### 3. **No Wake Word** 🚫
- Removed "Hey SyncUp" feature completely
- Questions ONLY via chatbox now
- Simpler and more reliable
