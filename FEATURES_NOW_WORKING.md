## Troubleshooting

### Command Palette Not Answering?
**Check:**
1. Press F12 → Console
2. Look for: "⚡ Command palette question:"
3. Look for: "✅ Command palette answer generated"
4. If errors, check Gemini API key in background.js

### Floating Button Not Visible?
**Check:**
1. Are you on Google Meet? (button hidden there by design)
2. Hard reload page: Ctrl+Shift+F5
3. Check console for: "🔘 Floating button added"
4. Look at bottom-right corner

### Side Panel Empty?
**Expected!** The side panel shows:
- Activity as you browse and use features
- Context cards as they're generated
- Action items as they're detected

It will populate as you use the extension.
